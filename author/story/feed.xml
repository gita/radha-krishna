	     <p>Before the Mahabharat war, Yādavas and many other kings met at Kurukṣetra during a solar eclipse. Krishna also met the residents of Vrindavana after a long time and gave them great joy.</p>

<p>Krishna and his wives then went to meet the Pandavas. He asked Yudhisthira and His other relatives whether they were well. They replied, “My Lord, anyone who has just once consumed through his ears the sweet nectar of Your pastimes can never know misfortune.”</p>

<p>Then Draupadī inquired from Krishna’s wives how the Lord had come to marry them.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/radhakrishna.jpg" alt="radhakrishna" /></p>

<p>Queen Rukmini spoke first: “Many kings, headed by Jarasandha, were intent on giving me in marriage to Shishupala. Thus at my wedding they all stood with bows in hand, ready to support Shishupala against any opponents. But Krishna came and forcibly took me away, as a lion takes his prey from amidst goats and sheep.”</p>

<p>Queen Satyabhama said, “When my uncle Prasena was killed, my father, Satrajit, falsely accused Lord Krishna of murder. To clear His name, Krishna defeated Jambavan, recovered the Syamantaka jewel and returned it to Satrājit. Repentant, my father presented the Lord with both the jewel and myself.”</p>

<p>Queen Jambavati said, “When Krishna entered my father’s cave in search of the Syamantaka jewel, at first my father, Jambavan, did not understand who He was. So my father fought with Him for twenty-seven days and nights. Finally, Jambavan understood that Krishna was none other than Lord Ram, his worshipable Lord. Thus he gave Krishna the Syamantaka jewel, along with me.”</p>

<p>Queen Kalindi said, “To obtain Krishna as my husband, I performed severe austerities. Then one day Lord Kṛṣṇa came to me in the company of Arjuna, and at that time the Lord agreed to marry me.”</p>

<p>Queen Mitravinda said, “Krishna came to my svayamvara ceremony, where He defeated all the opposing kings and took me away to His city of Dvaraka.”</p>

<p>Queen Satya said, “My father stipulated that to win my hand, a prospective suitor would have to subdue and tie up seven powerful bulls. Accepting this challenge, Lord Krishna playfully subdued them, defeated all His rival suitors and married me.”</p>

<p>Queen Bhadra said, “My father invited his nephew Kṛṣṇa, to whom I had already given my heart, and offered me to Him as His bride.”</p>

<p>Queen Lakshmana said to Draupadī, “At my svayamvara, as at yours, a fish-target was fastened near the ceiling. But in my case the fish was concealed on all sides, and only its reflection could be seen in a pot of water below. Several kings tried to hit the fish with an arrow but failed. Arjuna then made his attempt. He concentrated on the reflection of the fish in the water and took careful aim, but when he released his arrow it only grazed the target. Then Krishna fixed His arrow on the bow and shot it straight through the target, knocking it to the ground. I placed the victory necklace on Krishna’s neck, but the kings who had failed raised a violent protest. Lord Krishna valiantly fought them, cutting off the heads, arms and legs of many and sending the rest fleeing for their lives. Then the Lord took me to Dvaraka for our lavish wedding.”</p>

<p>Queen Rohini, representing all the other queens, explained that they were daughters of the kings defeated by Bhaumasura. The demon had held them captive, but when Krishna killed him He had released them and married them all.</p>

	     <p>There’s a story mentioned in the Puranas about the birth of Radha, the eternal consort of Shri Krishna. Radha is considered to be an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Goddess Lakshmi was hesitant to take birth on Earth before the birth of Lord Vishnu as Shri Krishna. Lord Vishnu tried to convince her but she didn’t want to appear on Earth while Vishnu was still in Vaikuntha Lok. She finally agreed upon the condition that after her birth, she will open her eyes for the first time only when Krishna appears before her. Vishnu agreed to this condition. The day of her appearance on the Earth is known as Radhashtami.</p>

<p>On a half-moon night in the month of Bhadra, Vrishabhanu Maharaja went to the bank of the river Yamuna at around noon to take a midday bath. At that moment he saw a huge lotus floating on the water with a golden aura as bright as a thousand suns emanating from it. When Vrishabhanu went closer to the lotus, he saw the most beautiful and radiant form of a baby girl lying within the petals of the lotus. Vishabhanu was happy to see the baby girl and took her home. His wife Kirtida was delighted when she saw the beautiful baby and immediately arranged for all kinds of religious rites to be performed and donated thousands of cows to the Brahmanas. He and his wife named the baby girl Radha.</p>

<p>Soon they noticed that Radha is not opening her eyes. Vrishabhanu and his wife feared that their baby girl was perhaps blind from birth. At that time, Narada Muni appeared and advised him to make arrangements for a lavish birth celebration and sent out invitations to all the residents of Raval and Gokula and especially to his dear friend Nanda Maharaja and his family.</p>

He crawled up to the cot in which Radhika was lying and pulled Himself up and looked in and His gaze fell upon the beautiful moon-like face of baby Radhika. At that moment, Srimati Radharani’s eyes fluttered and opened wide and blossomed like lotuses for the very first time and looked directly at Krishna, who was the first person that She had ever seen. It seems that she did not want to see anything of this world, only the form of Sri Krishna. Vrishabhanu and Kirtida were overjoyed to find out that their beloved daughter Radhika, was not blind after all. Everyone was delighted.</p>
